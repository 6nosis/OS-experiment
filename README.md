# OSExperiment
This is my operating system experiment work, including two algorithms for processor scheduling and one algorithm for deadlock prevention.Although very simple, but used the object-oriented thought to write, later if you have time, hope to be able to expand, eventually become a relatively perfect in functions of Java operating system (of course,unlikely).
